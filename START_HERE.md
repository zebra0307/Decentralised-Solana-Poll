# üéâ ALL TASKS COMPLETED - Quick Reference

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Fixed Network Error

### The Problem:
"You are connected to Localnet but your account is not found on this cluster."

### The Solution:
**Just click the network dropdown in your app and select "Devnet"!**

### Why This Happens:
- **Localnet** = Your local blockchain (starts fresh, no accounts)
- **Devnet** = Public test network (where your wallet exists)
- **Your wallet** has an account on Devnet, not Localnet

### Network Configuration Files:
1. **Frontend**: `src/components/solana/solana-provider.tsx` (line 7)
2. **Backend**: `anchor/Anchor.toml` (line 19)
3. **Client**: `lib/anchorClient.ts` (line 4)

---

## ‚úÖ Task 2: Fixed All Code Errors

### Errors Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Removed old `/app` directory conflicts
2. ‚úÖ Cleaned build cache (`.next`)
3. ‚úÖ Verified all files exist
4. ‚úÖ CSS warnings are cosmetic only (Tailwind works fine)

### Script Created:
Run anytime you have issues:
```bash
./fix-errors.sh
```

# Get SOL for deployment (costs ~2 SOL)
solana airdrop 2

# Check balance
solana balance
```

### 2. Build (1 minute)
```bash
cd /home/rammsey/Decentralized-Solana-Poll
anchor build
```

### 3. Deploy (1 minute)
```bash
anchor deploy
```

## üí° Common Questions

### Q: Why does it say "account not found"?
**A:** You're on Localnet but your wallet is on Devnet. Switch to Devnet in dropdown.

### Q: How do I get SOL for testing?
**A:** 
- Devnet: `solana airdrop 2` or https://faucet.solana.com/
- Localnet: `solana airdrop 10 --url localhost`

### Q: Where is my program deployed?
**A:** Already on Devnet at `F3cGjvGtWfEFGsRTDwmTvD8LAiJ8h8MyXBxhDQc1hyEs`

### Q: How do I test locally?
**A:** 
```bash
# Terminal 1
solana-test-validator

# Terminal 2
anchor deploy --provider.cluster localnet
solana airdrop 10 --url localhost
```

### Q: What if deployment fails?
**A:** See "Part 5: Troubleshooting" in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### Q: Can I deploy to mainnet?
**A:** Yes, but it costs real SOL. Test thoroughly on Devnet first!
